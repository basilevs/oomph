		<h1 data-generate="setProductName(this)">Eclipse IDE</h1>
		<p>
			Each IDE distributed by the Eclipse Foundation is composed from the contents of a number of Eclipse projects.
			Generally each project contributes its content to the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-simrel">Eclipse Simultaenous Release</a>.
			The <a href="">Eclipse Packaging project</a> assembles a subset of that project content into the various IDEs
			available on the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">download page</a> and in the Eclipse Installer
			This makes it challenging to report an issue to the project that contributes the faulty component.
			Moreover, it's not possible to transfer issues across GitHub organizations so ideally one reports problems in the right project organization.
		</p>
		<h1>Problem Reporting</h1>
		<p>
			This page adapts itself to the product from which it is opened via the <code>Help &rarr; Report a Problem</code> menu.
			The sidebar to the right lists the projects that are incorporated into the IDE package you are using.
			Of course you may well have installed additional features from the Eclipse Simultaenous repository,
			or even from Eclipse Marketplace.
			In any case, the list on the side bar to the right is a good place to start.
			Please have a quick read though the description for the project to determine if that is indeed a suitable place to report an issue.
			Please read also the following advice at least once to ensure that you submit a high-quality problem report.
		</p>

		<h2>Details, Details, Details...</h2>
		<p>
			When reporting issues, providing appropriate details is the key to success.
			The developer will need to know which version of which software you using.
		</p>
		<div data-generate="generateQueryParametersTable(this)">
		</div>
		<p>
			Most important, the developer will need to know how to reproduce the problem that you are seeing.
			If the developer can't reproduce the problem, it won't be fixed.
			Better to provide too much detail than not enough.
			Picture is worth a thousand words.
			All browsers provide really good support for simply copying a screen capture and pasting it into the issue entry field.
			It's also easy to drag and drop a short video or a zip file contianing a sample for reprodcing the problem.
		</p>

		<h3>The Error Log </h3>

		<p>
			Often when things good badly wrong, errors are logged.
			You can open the <code>Error Log</code>view via quick search.
		</p>
		<div>
			<img class="box" src="images/OpenErrorLogViaQuickSearch.png" />
		</div>

		<p>
			The view contains useful details for helping track down a problem.
		</p>
		<div>
			<img class="box" src="images/ErorLogView.png" />
		</div>

		<p>
			You can double click an entry to see the details.
		</p>
		<div>
			<img class="box" src="images/LogEntryDetails.png" />
		</div>

		<p>
			Whenever possible, please include the <code>Exception Stack Trace</code> and the <code>Session Data</code> when reporting an issue
			using <code>```</code> in the markdown to format it nicely.
		</p>

		<h3>Open Discovered Type</h3>
		<p>
			The Java source code of all Eclipse Foundation projects is indexed.
			You can use <code>Navigate &rarr; Open Discovered Type</code> to search this index.
			If you copy a class name,
			e.g., <code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Resource</code>,
			from the stack trace in the error log,
			you can locate the source code.
		</p>
		<div>
			<img class="box" src="images/OpenDiscoveredType.png" />
		</div>

		<p>
			Note in particular that this gives you information about the GitHub or GitLab oganization and even the repository of that organization, e.g.,
			<code>https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt</code>.
			Keep in mind that problems are often caused by misuse of the framework farther down in the stack.
			Also, stack traces are often long chains of exceptions where typically the final exception (cause) is the most signfiicant.
			In this specific case,
			SWT provides support for tracking cases where other software is not properly disposing resources,
			leaking handles which will eventually force the application to require a restart.
		</p>

		<h1>Simultaneous Release Projects</h1>

		<p>
			The following is a list of all projects that contribute to the Simultaneous Release.
			These are the projects most likely to be installed in your IDE.
			Each project is decorated with the branding icon of each IDE in which it is installed by default,
			and each provides is a short description as well a link to the project's website.
			Most important, there is a link to the project's GitHub or GitLab organization for reporting issues against one of that project organization's repositorie which are also listed.
